A starting point for a simple Bukkit-based (CraftBukkit) Minecraft server. Implements many of the commonly used mods into a centralized code base and unified plugin file.

My goal was to learn the Bukkit library for Minecraft and learn more about creating stand-alone jar files that load dynamically server-side. Also, I wanted to create a mod that was truely stand-alone that didn't have any large (i.e. ProtectionMod or SQL) dependencies. The resulting mod is a single jar file that produces all files necessary for managing a simple SMP / Creative Minecraft server.

Want to setup your own server? Read the installation notes and configuration on the [Configuration](Configuration.md) page.

  * An **active test server** can be found at nint22.dyndns.org:25565 (Default port)
  * [Developer's Site](http://cores2.com)
  * [Server status on Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/CoreS2Minecraft)
  * [Live server map](http://nint22.dyndns.org)

This software is free (meaning both free to use and open source), but not free for me to make. BasicBukkit is a small project but it takes time and money to develop code and maintain the server. [Please donate; anything helps!](http://www.cores2.com/blog/?page_id=22)
